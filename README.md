# Polyrhythmic Spiral

This polyrhythmic (definition below) spiral effect was inspired by the awesome work of [`@project_jdm`](https://www.youtube.com/@project_jdm) on YouTube.

It was created from scratch with plain old js on the canvas. I basically just reverse engineered the one in his video [here](https://youtu.be/4GaGnU8Ij2Y) to the best of my ability and then kinda morphed it into my own thing. It took a long freakin time.

I didn't know what polyrhythms were before seeing his content so I had to ask ChatGPT. I then had to ask ChatGPT again, but this time to explain like I'm 5 years old. Here is what it said:

You know when you're on a swing? Imagine there are two swings side by side. Your friend is swinging three times for every two times you swing. So, sometimes you're at the top together, but other times, you're not. When you're both at the top at the same time, that's like a polyrhythm in music. Two different beats, syncing up at special moments.

Anyways, in the settings object below I have outlined a few different parameters to make it easier to modify some of the core features i.e. start time, total duration, number of cycles, etc.

I didn't know a good way to get instrument sound effects, in particular multiple octaves worth, so I made my own on SoundTrap using the vibraphone. A couple other ones are also listed below.

If you want to get your hands dirty you can also take a whack at modifying the code. Just be careful messing with how the notes are played. I almost went deaf a few times lol. And feel free to use this for literally anything.
